# Abundance_Output

- download, clean and filter copy number, transcriptomics and proteomic data from CPTAC
- calculate copy number-RNA and RNA-protein abundance correlations, identify gene features affecting them
- clean protein complexes dataset and calculate stoichiometric imbalance for each complex based on member abundances
- estimate activity of each regulatory protein based on the expression levels of its targets using VIPER and ULM
